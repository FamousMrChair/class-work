Worked with Ariella 

similarities 
- in all programs, Hello, world! is surrounded in quotation marks because it's a string 
- both python and netlogo use the command `print` to print the message
- scheme and python both utilize parentheses

differences
- scheme uses `display` to print (compared to `print` in the other languages)
- nlogo does not need parentheses (but adding them still allows you to run the code)
- scheme surrounds the entire procedure in parentheses, python only requires the argument to be surrounded by parentheses

notes:
- I don't remember how to change the context in netlogo to observer (I only recall the ask command affecting turtles or patches
